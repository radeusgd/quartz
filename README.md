# quartzlang

The grammar is defined in separate file: grammar.pdf

Quartz is a functional language featuring polymorphism, lazy evaluation, custom datatypes, pattern matching and builtin IO structure with do-notation that allow imperative programming.

Additionally there's `fuel` concept - every function call is counted, so that it's possible to run programs with given `call-quota` and they are terminated if they exceed it.
